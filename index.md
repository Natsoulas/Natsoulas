I am a rising Senior at Cornell University, pursuing a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Aerospace Engineering. I am currently interning at NASA Glenn Research Center as a Guidance, Navigation, and Controls Engineer where I work on Rapid Attitude Control System design in the COMPASS Lab. 

This Fall, I will be interning at Blue Origin working on Guidance, Navigation and Controls in their Advanced Development Program.

My interests lie in Astrodynamic Simulations, Non-linear Controls, Autonomous Controls, and Optimization.
