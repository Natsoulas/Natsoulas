title: Welcome to my personal professional website! 
---

Welcome to my website, I really am excited to start sharing my professional life with the world. I am currently still developing this website from a template, but the home page should give you a start. It has a short description of where I am in my carreer and has embedded links including one to my resume. I plan to publish my projects here and maybe even keep up a regular blog with carreer and academic updates. Thanks!
